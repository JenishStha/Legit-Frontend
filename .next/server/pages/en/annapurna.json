The mountains and the areas around are protected by Annapurna Conservation Area, the biggest conservation area in Nepal. This region has incredibly popular trekking routes, and the trail around the Annapurna Circuit circles the Annapurna Range. The Annapurna Sanctuary Trek reaches the Annapurna base camp with several smaller and slightly less complicated paths to follow.\n\nSo now grab your water bottles trekking gear, and get to ABC in group or solo to have the best trekking experience within the trekking trails.\n\nFrom the upper Kaligandaki valley, it is possible to trek up to base camps used to climb Mt. Annapurna I and Dhaulagiri I from the Annapurna base camp. Annapurna I is the tenth highest mountain globally, at 8091 meters above sea level.\n\nAnnapurna massif measures 59 kilometers (34 miles). It borders the Kali Gandaki Gorge to the west, the Marshyangdi River north and east, and Pokhara Valley to the south. At its west end, the mountain surrounds the Annapurna Sanctuary.\n\n## Mountain views that leave you spellbound\n\nAnnapurna's mountain ranges will satiate your thirst to see beautiful snow capped mountains. Before a hike starts, a hike to the mystic land, ABC trek(Annapurna Base Camp) trek. In Ghandruk, you have a clear view over Machapuchare, Annapurna Range, and Hiunchuli. Views of various peaks on Annapurna massif are available from Sinuwa. Machapuchare teases you on Dovan. Machapuchare emerges from the forests behind Himalaya and Deurali and reflects his glory before your eye. Machapuchare, the 'fish tails' mountain has an excellent reputation with Nepal is as a stunning beauty. This is regarded as the house of Lord Shiva. However, the summit was not officially held.\n\n## A peek into Nepali culture\n\nUsually a traditional teahouse trek, accommodation can take place within small lodge rooms that generally accommodate 20-25 people. This operation is managed locally. During the tourist season, there are also people from Nepal that migrate there to do their jobs. Interaction with staff in teahouses, guides, and porters will give you insight into their daily routine. Many people speak English, which helps in communicating. Tea House meals are made according to Nepali traditions. Often the dishes are similar to Indian foods. Ghandruk has one of the largest settlement villages in this region. As you start this hike, you will come across several small villages with less than 100 residents.\n\n## A melting pot of adventurous souls\n\nThe ABC trek attracts mountain enthusiasts from everywhere. The scenery is considered excellent in the autumn, and expect a range of languages along the trail. Teahouses are a comfortable space for discussing a conversation with someone from wherever they are located. It is remarkably rare for people to encounter such diversity during their treks. Banners: Chaitan Sharma.\n\n## Trek Itinerary\n\n### Day 1: Kathmandu to Pokhara\n\nFlight time: 30 min\n\nBus drive: 5-7 hours\n\nAccommodation: Hotel\n\nPokhara is one of Nepal's most beautiful tourist destinations; it's well connected by road and air services from Kathmandu. There are 30-50 daily Regular flights between Pokhara to Kathmandu. At the same time, many more during high seasons when demand exceeds supply because this place has something for everyone! Chartered Flights & Helicopters can get you there quickly as well. So if you get some time, try to roam around Pokhara. Pokhara won't let you down!\n\nA rough flight coach ride will take you through turbulent mountain terrain and twisty valleys before landing smoothly onto the tarmac of Pokhara Airport. In addition, various bus services can be taken for inbound or outbound trips. Still, I recommend taking an air-conditioned vehicle or flying by air to Pokhara.\n\nPokhrelis, the inhabitants of Pokhara, shall serve you with the best hospitality ever! Keep someone for your company, but if you're looking to solo too, Pokhara is your type of adventure!\n\nPokhara is the host of many natural and scenic destinations, where you shall go through Machhapuchhre base camp on the way to ABC Trek. You shall have the best company here!\n\nPokhara, the land of Magars and Gurungs, is a wild place where hardworking farmers are known for their bravery as soldiers. \n\nLikewise, the Thakalis, another important ethnic group in this area, has been recognized internationally because they're entrepreneurs with an innovative spirit that helps them succeed no matter what obstacles come along on the way.\n\nThe people here make up part one: \"Gurkha,\" which means \"soldier\" or, more specifically, Nepal's legendary force- indeed, those recruited from amongst these mountains represent almost half its military strength!\n\n### Day 02: Nayapul to Ulleri(2080 meters)\n\nVehicle Drive: 1 hour\n\nTrekking Time: 6 hours\n\nAccommodation: Teahouse\n\nWe woke up early in the morning and took a jeep. You can also take a taxi or other vehicles. After the road trip (depending upon traffic), you'll arrive at Nayapul, where our trek to Annapurna base camp began! You're now set off on a fantastic adventure.\n\nThe hike is an introduced journey that takes place in the rugged mountains. The scenic views will amaze you with their variety of colors and textures, from lowland pastures to powerful glaciers! There are many stops for relaxing activities along this trail, such as soaking natural hot springs or eating delicious Nepali food at villages along your route.\n\nThis trek has it all - scenery galore, including thundering waterfalls where we can picnic under shady trees while listening to nature's harmoniously blended together; crossing icy rivers that might require some careful footing on exposed rocks at!\n\nGear up and follow the Bhurungi Khola to Thikhedhunga, trek through farmland before a steep ascent. As you ascend higher into Ulleri's mountainsides, there is an opportunity for exploration on your terms as well!\n\nThe local trails through the beautiful forests and farmlands before reaching the Ulleri settlement site near a telescoping waterfall. We stayed in a teahouse in Ulleri for accommodation.\n\n### Day 03: Ghorepani\n\nTrekking Time: 6 hours\n\nAccommodation: Teahouse\n\nYou'll be amazed by the beauty of this forest! A leisurely walk from Ulleri village will take you to Ghorepani, where accommodation is available. If it's a clear day, then enjoy some tea and conversation with locals before bedtime at Ghorepani - they are very friendly here.\n\nAscend through rhododendron groves that feel more authentic than any flowers your grandmother has ever shown off on her property; afterward, stay overnight in one of its teahouses.\n\nYou can also extend your trek from Ghorepani to go for Ghandruk and Poon hill. However, you can skip this to reach to Tadapani.\n\nGhandruk village is the most popular hiking destination in Nepal. The friendly Gurung people and their customs make this trekking area so unique, not to mention there's no other place like it on earth! You'll be blown away by how pristinely beautiful everything looks when you step outside of your expectations for an ordinary day-to-day life back home - that includes both architectures as well landscapes here since they're one in the same thing anyway down from those who live above them or below depending if you go up further towards higher elevations which means more oxygen levels but also different weather patterns too.\n\nThe village is the gateway for trekkers while **trekking in the Annapurna region**. People who are going for the Annapurna Base Camp trek, Poon Hill Trek, Annapurna Circuit Trek, and upper Mustang trek stay a night at this place.\n\n### Day 04: Tadapani(2700meters)\n\nTrekking Time: 6 hours\n\nAccommodation: Teahouse\n\nAnnapurna is one of the tallest mountains in the world in the tenth position. It is also considered a sacred mountain. It's also excellent, with many rivers running through it that are famous for rafting during low water periods when they're not overflowing their banks due to rainfall or snowmelt at higher elevations on upper slopes where there may still be some left over after all this time since last year's monsoon season passed by – if you're lucky enough come across them while exploring around town!\n\nA trip from a foreign country to Nepal for the Annapurna base camp might seem like an unusual idea. Still, does it make sense now, seeing how much scenery can be seen en route?\n\n### Day 05: Ghandruk-Kimrung Khola - Chomrong-Sinuwa(2177m/7143ft)\n\nTrekking Time: 6 hours\n\nAccommodation: Teahouse\n\nYou'll begin your day with a leisurely ride down Kimrung Khola and make an ascent up Chomrong village. You will be able to see Annapurna, Macchhapucchhre, and pizza in the distance!\n\nKomrong is situated in an elevated position. From Komrong, you see Chomrung at the opposite end of Mount Kimrong Khola. Depart Komrong to Kimrong. You cross the water in a few minutes if you are lucky. The trail starts in this area and reaches Khola at Kimrong Khola within an hour. Once Kimrong Khola is crossed, stay on your left. Then follow Kimrong Khola down the mountain. A muddy path ascends slowly. You'll be able to find Komrong in a different spot. Snowcapped mountains such as Machapuchhre, Annapurna, South Hiunchuli, and Gangalpurna gradually show up.\n\nThe slope is lined with stone-and-sand house roofs that date back centuries. There will be many scattered around the village in the whole area among the teahouses. This is a new experience for tea house trekking. You will experience it during your trip. Starting in Ghandruk, the trail descends slowly towards the Kyunri Khola River. After crossing the bridge over water, the trail splits. Take the right path – it climbs steeply, approximately a half-hour to Komrong (7380 feet).\n\nChomrung (7012 metres/2,177 m) to Sinuwa (765 feet/2,393 meters) The trek today starts with descending stone steps towards Chomrung villages. Along Chommrung, on about 500 m, you find teahouses on both sides. Within 20 min. Chomrung Khola will be there.\n\nCheck out from the AAPAC office in Chommrung before your departure.\n\nThe only guest house before the bridge is named Sinuwa. Ignore it because Sinuwa is only an hour away. The trail is steeped on stone steps following the bridge. Fifteen minutes of climbing brings you to Tilche village with several houses. A 10 min. Hike on Tilch leads you back to Lower Sinuwa. From this point, the path climbs up steep steps to upper Sinuwa.\n\n### Day 06: **Sinuwa - Bamboo - Dovan - Deurali(2670 meters)**\n\nTrekking Time: 5 hours\n\nAccommodation: Teahouse\n\nWe were excited to continue exploring the Annapurna massif. All of us woke up early for our trip, and we had some breakfast before going out about what this beautiful country Nepal has to offer!\n\nDovan (8460 feet/2,553 meters) - Himalaya (9510 feet/2,891 meters): A trail winds gradually from Dovan toward the Himalaya. Your way will end with a fork on a path that takes a left turn in a couple of minutes. Pass through the bridge that you reach within 15 minutes. Continue. The trail includes short sections on steep or gradual climbs. Walk along with the shrine to the right and get the next fork on the track. The two paths head towards the Himalayas. The mud trail at the left is longer and steeper and is joined 5-10 minutes later in one piece. The following 10 min climbing leads to the point where the path leads into the Modi Khola.\n\nThe hike to Deurali is a challenging but rewarding experience. You will be trekking through the jungle with plenty of opportunities for wildlife viewing as well! Once you reach your destination at 3200 meters above sea level - there are no cars or buses, so it's easy enough just get lost among these picturesque mountainside views without any distractions from manmade structures... unless someone spots one small puddle. Within all this lush green scenery?\n\nYou should know about the Annapurna region that she's a goddess of food. She protects the farmers, giving them omens and blessings in return for their hard work - but not just any old kind! Her gifts are those traditionally associated with women: gold coins filled with delicious ideas like how best to cook this or plant more so we can have an even greater harvest next year; fresh fruit straight from her garden, which will make all your taste buds go crazy happy while they're still alive. And what would life be without friends? One word: lonely\n\n### Day 07: Deurali to Machapuchare Base Camp-**Annapurna Base Camp(4130 meters)**\n\nTrekking Time: 3-4 hours\n\nAccommodation: Teahouse\n\nYou will trek to Annapurna Base Camp, located at 4130m. The trail is all uphill, and when you get here, it's very difficult for some people because they have been feeling tired from climbing so much on this trip, but if that doesn't bother me, I'm ready! Once we reach Machhapuchhre base camp again with lovely views of Machhapuchhre, Annapurna South, Himchuli, Gandharva Chuli, Glacier Dom, Annapurna III, Gangapurna, etc. alongside each other as well sunset over them makes this trip even more memorable.\n\nStart from the Machapuchare Basecamp. The peaks glowing at sunrise are worth seeing. ABC lies 90° left of the way you come into the Camp. The initial 1km climb is steep. The path descends slowly. The sunrise passes Annapurna and gradually extends towards Annapurna when walking on the road. This last stretch of ABC takes you through Moraines. You'll find a Marmut while driving into ABC if you have luck. Set against a fantastic mountain at ABC. Annapurnas III, I and I, Gandharvachula, and Machapuchare are right behind you.\n\n### Day 08:**Annapurna Base Camp - MBC- Deurali - Himalayan - Dovan -Bamboo(2335 meters)**\n\nTrekking Time: 6-7 hours\n\nAccommodation: Teahouse\n\nYou will wake up in the morning to see all of Annapurna I, Barahi Shikhar, Tent Peak, Annapurna South, Himchuli, Gandharva Chuli, and other mountain peaks in Annapurna Range. After that, you can have breakfast before hiking from ABC down towards Bamboo via Machhapuchhre Base Camp, Deurali, Himalayan,dovan. Bamboo is located at 2340 meters high; it's 6-7 hours on foot with an overnight stay Lodge along the way!\n\n### Day 09: Bamboo-Sinuwa-Chomrong-Jhinu Danda(1780)\n\nTrekking Time: 5 hours\n\nAccommodation: Teahouse\n\nAfter breakfast, you will trek from Bamboo to Jhinu Danda, with an elevation of 1780 m. This can take up to 5 hours depending on how fast one walks and which route they choose for the day's journey! In the afternoon, after a long morning walk or, in some cases, longer than others (elevation changes), Natural hot springs are waiting just around. So all your muscles feel relaxed once again before bedtime arrives at Lodge that evening.\n\nContinue to walk along paved paths through houses. These sections of the trail combine gradual and steep climbs. The butterflies can thrive anywhere between 5000 to 1000 feet above the water. The colorful display reflects this as you get closer to Jhinu. Follow the trail from New Bridge. There's a fork on Landruk's left and Kyumi's right in less than five minutes. Then, follow a path to Kyoto.\n\n### Day 10: Mokyu-Nayapul-Pokhara\n\nTrekking Time: 2 hours\n\nAccommodation: Hotel\n\nTake a steep descent from Jhinu and reach Mokyu within 2 hours. Follow the trail to your right once you have crossed over the bridge. From Mokyu, it takes around 3 hours to reach Pokhara.\n\n## Trekking in the forests of Annapurna Conservation Area\n\nIt leads to various vegetation. When trekking between Ghandruk & Chomrung, there are rhododendrons, ferns, and bamboos. As soon as a visitor enters Sinuwa and Annapurna Sanctuary, the forest becomes thick. Tall oaks dominate the place. On the way to Deurali, the dense forest becomes tall grass. In this region, you will see thick tree bark known by the name Daphne. The locals use it for papermaking. This tree is also common in the Sandakphu region. Near Machapuchare base camp, the landscape turns Alpine. There is grass among the boulders. I saw the same. Several flowering plants line the trail in the area below.\n\n## Trek with Porter and Guide\n\n## Why is Annapurna Base Camp Trek among the most popular treks in the world?\n\nAnnapurna Base camp trek is a popular trek worldwide due to its spectacular landscapes and snow-capped mountains. This brings the experience to life with Eight Million Miles - and for a moderate difficulty-packed journey, that's awesome! The impressive Annapurna Range contains the 10th tallest peak in all of Asia. Annapurna I (8091 meters) offers dangerous mountain attractions. Among the 8 thousand people, this mountain has the highest fatalities rate. Aside from that impressive aura, the ABC trek holds many valuables for mountain lovers.\n\n# Notable mountaineering facts\n\nAnnapurna I became famous in 1950 as the first peak above 26,000 feet (8,000 meters) to be ascended to the summit. The feat was achieved by a **French expedition led** by Maurice Herzog, who with Louis Lachenal reached the top on June 3.\n\n1970, Tetsuji Kawada and Lhakpa Tenzing reached the summit with a **Japanese expedition** led by Tokufu Ohta and Shoji Imanari.\n\nMay 23, 1981, Maciej Berbeka and Boguslaw Probulski from Poland successfully climbed the tenth highest mountain, Annapurna I, through a new path.
