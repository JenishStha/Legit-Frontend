The Hindu believes that lord Vishnu got salvation from the curse of Brinda (wife of Jalandhar) here. Therefore, he is worshipped as Muktinath (Lit. the lord of salvation). The holy shrine, which is said to have arisen on its own, is one of eight such shrines (the others include Srirangam, Sri Mushnam, Tirupati, Naimisaranyam, Thottadri, Pushkaram, and Badrinath). This Pagoda Style Muktinath Temple is also one of 108 Vaishnava shrines. Here in the early 19th century the Hindus consecrated a Vishnu temple and named is Muktinath - Lord of Liberation.
